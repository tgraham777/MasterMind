# Master Mind

### Instructions

Mastermind generates a random combination of four colors: (r)ed, (b)lue,
(g)reen, and (y)ellow. You guess a random string of four letters representing
the colors (ex: rbgy). After each guess you will get feedback on how many of the
colors are correct and how many color positions are correct. The challenge is
to see how fast you can guess the right combination of colors. Good luck!
